# HackerRank Practice Problems

*Language: Python*

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions to various **HackerRank** coding challenges.
The problems focus on building proficiency in **Python syntax, algorithms, and basic data structures**, and are part of my ongoing practice to improve problem-solving speed and accuracy.

---

## Current Focus

* **Category:** Easy-level challenges (beginner-friendly but essential for strong fundamentals).
* **Topics Covered So Far:**

  * Arithmetic operations
  * Conditional logic (`if/else`)
  * Loops and iteration
  * Data types and type conversion
  * Nested lists and indexing
  * String formatting and printing

---

## Skills Demonstrated

* Translating problem statements into working Python code.
* Writing **readable, well-structured solutions**.
* Understanding edge cases and testing outputs.
* Gradual progression from basic syntax to more advanced problem-solving.

## How to Run

Open any `.py` file and run it with Python 3:

```bash
python EASY_Arithmetic_Operators.py
```
